codingal is on a mission to inspire school kids to fall in love with coding.
Coding helps develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Coding jobs are the future.
They already constitute more than 60% of all the jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.
While still in school, those who start young will be ahead of everyone by the time they get into college.
They will be creators of the future.
